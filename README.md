## Prerequisites
Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.12 or higher
pip (Python package installer)
A compatible web browser (for fetchhtml, Chrome is recommended)
ChromeDriver (for fetchhtml)

**Recommended**
- Use a python virtual environment
- Download chrome driver and put it inside the working folder
- Download chrome and put it inside the working folder

Do that so you dont need to change a lot of code

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JuanSobalvarro/productDataScripts.git

```
2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure to download and install the ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome version and place it in the appropriate directory.

## Scripts Overview
### fetchhtml
This script performs web scraping on the La Colonia website by rendering the page content with Selenium. It is useful for extracting data that is dynamically loaded via JavaScript.

- **Key Features**
  - Navigates to the La Colonia website.
  - Retrieves product information from rendered HTML.
  - Stores the extracted data in a CSV file.
- **Usage**
  - Run the script using Python.

### fetchapi
This script interacts with La Colonia's public API to fetch product data directly. It is suitable for obtaining structured data without the complexities of web scraping.

- **Key Features**

  - Fetches product data based on predefined categories.
  - Uses cookies from a Selenium session to authenticate requests.
  - Saves the obtained data in a CSV file.
- **Usage**
    - Run the script using Python.

### stadistics
This script analyzes the product data stored in a CSV file generated by the fetchhtml or fetchapi scripts. It produces various statistics and visualizations based on the product data.

- **Key Features**

    - Calculates basic statistics such as total products, average price, and stock availability.
    - Generates price distribution histograms and bar charts for average prices by category.
    - Provides correlation analysis between price and quantity.
- **Usage**

    - Run the script using Python.

## Usage
1. **Run fetchhtml:**

```bash
python fetchhtml.py
```
This will generate a CSV file with product data. Ensure you check the script for any category adjustments or specific options.

2. **Run fetchapi:**

```bash
python fetchapi.py
```
This will also generate a CSV file with product data from the API. Review the categories in the script to modify them as needed.

Run stadistics:

```bash
python stadistics.py
```
Make sure to update the file_path variable in the script to point to the correct CSV file generated from either fetchhtml or fetchapi.
